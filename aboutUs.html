            <h2>A Typical Woodchurch WI Meeting</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The evening officially starts at 7:15 pm, but most members arrive around 7:00 pm.</li>
                <li>At the door, you will be greeted by one of our committee members.  
                    Members stop here to pay their 50p  for a cup of tea or coffee which is served usually later in the evening.  
                    Visitors are asked for a donation to cover refreshments.</li>
                <li>Tables will be arranged so that members can have a chat while waiting for the meeting to begin.  
                    If you don't know anyone to sit with, just pick a free chair.....we are all very friendly.</li>
                <li>At 7:15 Lynn, our president, will welcome everyone and we stand to sing 'Jerusalem'.  
                    Don't worry if you don't know the words: we have them printed!</li>
                <li>Then follows the business part of the meeting (unless the speaker needs to leave early, in which case the speaker goes first and we have the business later).  
                    This is usually quite short (15-20 minutes) when we discuss future plans and so on.  </li>
                <li>The speaker then talks, usually answering questions afterwards.  
                    We try to have a wide variety of topics.  Look at the page: <a href="#">Programme</a> to see what's on this year.  
                    Occasionally we do not have a speaker: in May we  discuss the WI Resolutions, in October we have the AGM, when we elect next year's committee, and sometimes we make our own entertainment!  </li>
                <li>Then we have 'Social Time', an opportunity to chat, make new friends, vote in the monthly competition, buy a few raffle tickets, look at the trading table and have a nice cuppa.</li>
                <li>We finish at about 9:00pm.</li>
            </ul>
